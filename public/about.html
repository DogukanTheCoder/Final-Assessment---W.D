                    <h1> On this page I will give some additional information about myself and how I have come to build this website. </h1>
                        <p> As a 20 year old university student I have had acquired many hobbies along the years. Down below you can find a list of some of my favourite hobbies: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Playing Basketball</li>
                                <li>Swimming</li>
                                <li>Playing the Piano</li>
                                <li>Reading</li>
                                
                                </ul>  
                                <p> While creating this website I made use of the instructions that were given to me by the 'MyAberdeen' system and used my lecture notes to assist
                                  me with the tasks I have struggled with. Additionally, I also made use of my notes that I had acquired from the online HTML course on the w3schools
                                  website. After that I ensured that my web page had all the necessary navigational pages and carried out the instructions of the assignment on page 
                                  by page basis. I have also ensured to regularly check that my code validates to avoid any problems later on.
